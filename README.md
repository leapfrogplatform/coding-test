# Coding test

### Criteria:

- Cleanliness (is the code clean, readable and DRY ?)
- Structure (code layout, abstraction, modularisation)
- Functionality (does it work?)

## The tasks

- [Create an API (back-end)](#create-an-api)
- [JSON Placeholder Todolist app (front-end)](#json-placeholder-todolist-app)

Feel free to choose either task (or both if you want to impress us as a full stack developer) and email us a link to the git repository containing the solution at <info@leapfrog.ltd>.

Your git repository should have clear instructions on how to run your solution and some simple documentation of anything ambiguious.

Bonus points for sending us a link to a deployed version on your solution (any platform will do, no preference here).

## Create an API

You can do this test using any programming language and framework you wish, Bonus points if you do it in PHP using Laravel or in Javascript using Node and Express.

Create an API that lets users create, read, update (mark done/undone) and delete Todos.

Your solution should:

- Take and Return data in industry standard JSON format.
- Persist data after browser reloading (preferably in a DB).
- Follow standard Rest API convetions.

If you think of anything that can enhance the functionality and this API feel free to implement it, we appreciate creativity.

## JSON Placeholder Todolist App

You can use just HTML/CSS/JS for this test, but we'd prefer it if you used a front-end framework like Angular, React or Vue, either one is fine.

Consume [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API and obtain todos and show them in a nicely presented web app.

Use all API methods and allow the user to CRUD Todos.

Best of luck.
